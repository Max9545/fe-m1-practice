1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?


  HTML code controls what a user sees  and how they interact with a webpage.  We use HTML to control what is and isn't shown. Also it is used to display images, create links, and format the page.

2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?

  Elements are blocks of code which tell the browser to display whatever is within the element in a certain way. A tag is used to both open and close a element and gives information on how the info between the two tags is to be treated. The opening tag consists of the lesser and greater than signs: <html>. The closing tag is the same plus a forward slash after the less than sign: </html>  Tags come at the beginning and end of an element. An element consists of both opening and closing tags, and everything between the tags.

3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

   Attributes allow us to add more information to our elements, and can make them more dynamic by changing or adding info within the element. We name and give value to elements in the opening tag.

4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

  The head contains information about the page that will not be displayed within the browser window.  The head often has the title element within it which is the text that will show at the head of the browser window above the URL or on the tab name. The body element contains all of the information to be presented in the browser window.  Everything within the body tag will be displayed in the browser window.  

5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

  Option Command U is the same as clicking "View" and the "Developer" and then "View Source".  This will open a window displaying the code of the page that was selected.

6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

  1. <html>yyy</html>: means that everything within it will be read and processed in the HTML language.

  2. <title>yyy</title>: determines what is displayed in top of window or tab in browser, often above the URL.

  3. <head>yyy</head>: contains info that is not displayed in main window of browser.  Often includes the title element.

  4. <br /> provides a line break within a paragraph.

  5. <hr /> creates a horizontal line across the page in order to separate things.

6. What are empty elements?

  These are elements that do not have any words within an opening and closing tag. The horizontal line tag and the line break tag are examples of this.

7. What is semantic markup?

  Elements that are used to add information to the page without the goal of affecting its basic visual structure.  We add elements that many browsers do not display in order for the browser itself to better read and/or translate our code.  Also if our code is put into another process besides that of a browser (such as a text to speech reader) semantic markup may give that application additional information.

8. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

    1. <header> Used for the main header of the page.
    2. <nav> Is to group together the links that are the main navigational tool of the site.
    3. <aside> is used to display information that relates to an article or page but is not directly needed.  It adds a side bar which can contain definitions and links and the like.
